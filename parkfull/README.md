### Is the Parking Lot Full?
This is a simple app that allows people to help others know if the parking lot at the park is full or not.  The idea came out of a summer spent needing to drive over an hour away to the national park to figure out if the parking lot was full or not.  During the pandemic parks responded by limiting the number of people allowed into the park, but the official websites do not indicate when the lot is full or not.  Oftentimes it was impossible to get through to park employees over the phone as well.  Is The Parking Lot Full is a place where users can go to find out if the parking lot is full at their favorite park.  

The app will start by featuring the National Parks in Quebec in Ontario and will have the option to expand over time.  

## How is the app set up?

The app is set up with a React fontend and an node/express backend.
Material-Ui is used for the navigation bar.
Installed react-router-dom to handle routes in the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
